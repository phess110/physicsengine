    <h2>Current</h2>
    <p class="text" id="current-text">
        By convention the current is always drawn in the direction positive charge carriers would move. The current density \(\vec{J}\) is 
        defined so that \(i = \int \vec{J} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{A}.\) \(\vec{J}\) has the same direction as \(i\). We can compute the drift speed \(v_d\)
        of electrons in a conductor. The amount of charge in a conductor of uniform cross section \(A\) and length \(L\) is \(q=(nAL)e\) where \(n\)
        is the number of charge carriers per unit volume. The time for an electron to travel across the conductor is \(t = \frac{L}{v_d}.\) Since 
        \(i = \frac{q}{t} = \frac{nALev_d}{L}\) it follows \(v_d = \frac{i}{nAe} = \frac{J}{ne}\)$$\vec{v_d} = \frac{\vec{J}}{ne}.$$
    </p>

    <h2>Resistance & Resistivity</h2>
    <p class="text" id="resistance-text">
        The resistance of an object is defined by \(R = \frac{V}{i}.\)

        The resistivity of a material is defined by \(\rho = \frac{E}{J}.\) The conductivity \(\sigma = \frac{1}{\rho}.\)

        For homogenous, isotropic conductors with uniform cross section, \(E = \frac{V}{L}\) and \(J = \frac{i}{A}.\) Thus 
        $$\rho = \frac{E}{J} = \frac{VA}{iL} = R \frac{L}{A}.$$

        Ohm's law is the assertion that \(i\) is always directly proportional to the applied potential. 

        \(a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{eE}{m}\) and \(v_d = a \tau = \frac{eE\tau}{m}\) where \(\tau\) is the average time between collision of the electron with atoms in the metal.
        Combining with \(v_d = \frac{J}{ne}\), we have \(E = \left(\frac{m}{e^2 n\tau}\right)J\). Since \(E =\rho J\), it follows \(\rho = \frac{m}{e^2n \tau}.\) Thus Ohm's law is the
        claim that \(\rho\) is constant as \(V\) varies, which is essentially a claim that \(\tau\) is constant. However, \(v_d\) is typically several orders of magnitude (say 10) smaller than its effective velocity
        due to its thermal energy; hence Ohm's law ostensibly holds (at least when temperature is held constant).

    <h2>Power</h2>
    <p class="text" id="power-text">
            Power is the rate of energy transfer. \(\mathrm{d}U = V\mathrm{d}q = Vi \mathrm{d}t \) Thus $$P = \frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}t} = iV.$$
            In particular, for a resistor $$P = i^2R = \frac{V^2}{R}.$$
