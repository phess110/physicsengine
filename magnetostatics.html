        <h1>Magnetism</h1>
    
        <h2>Magnetic Force</h2>
        <p class="text" id="mag-force-text"> 
         The magnetic force on a particle of charge \(q\) and velocity \(\vec{v}\) experiencing a magnetic field \(\vec{B}\) is 
            $$\vec{F_B} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}.$$
        The magnitude of the force is thus \(|q|vB\sin\theta.\) 

        The magnetic field lines are drawn from the northm pole to the south pole. Opposite poles attract and like poles repel.
        </p>

        <h2>Thompson</h2>
        <p class="text" id="thomson-text"> 
         Thomson's experiment involved crossed fields, i.e. where an electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular to each other. Say 
         \(\vec{e}\) is down the page and \(\vec{B}\) is into the page. 

         Suppose a particle is shot with velocity \(\vec{v_x}\) perpendicular to both fields. Over a distance \(L\), the deflection due to \(\vec{E}\)
         is $$y = \frac{qEL^2}{2mv_x^2}.$$

         In order for the magnitudes of the magnetic and electric forces on the particle to cancel, we require $$E = vB \qquad \text{ or } \qquad v = \frac{E}{B}.$$
         Combining these equations we have $$\frac{m}{q}  = \frac{(BL)^2}{2yE}.$$Thus we can compute the mass-to-charge ratio for moving charged particles.
        </p>

        <h2>Hall</h2>
        <p class="text" id="hall-text"> 
         Suppose we have a conducting sheet with current \(i\) (heading down the page), length \(l\), and width \(d\), and we place it into an external, uniform magnetic field into the page.
         An electric drifts upwards the page with speed \(v_d\) and experiences a magnetic force \(\vec{F_B}\) to the right. After some time, enough electrons accumulate on the right side of the sheet
         to form a potential difference (Hall potential: \(V = Ed\)) and thus an electric field strong enough that we reach equilibrium. 

         If charge carriers in the sheet were positive, the left side would have the low potential and the right side the high potential. Because this isn't
         the case, we can conclude charge carriers are negative.

         In equilibrium, \(eE = ev_dB.\) Recalling \(v_d = \frac{J}{ne}= \frac{i}{nAe},\) we have \(\frac{V}{d} = \frac{i}{nAe} B.\)Hence 
         $$n = \frac{iB}{eV} \frac{d}{A} = \frac{iB}{elV}.$$Thus, we can measure the number of charge carriers per unit volume. 

         Finally, suppose we move the plate in the direction of \(-\vec{v_d}\), increasing the speed until the net velocity of the electrons is 0.
         Then, \(F_B=0\), so the Hall potential will be 0. Thus we can measure drift velocity.
        </p>

        <h2>Biot-Savart's Law</h2>
        <p class="text" id="bs-law-text"> 
         We can find the magnetic field at a point \(P\) due to a current via $$\mathrm{d}\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{i \mathrm{d}\vec{s} \times \hat{r}}{r^2}$$ where 

         <ul>
             <li>\(\mu_0 = 4\pi \cdot 10^{-7}\) T m/A is the magnetic permeability constant.</li>
             <li>\(\mathrm{d}\vec{s}\) is a vector in the direction of current along the wire.</li>
             <li>\(\hat{r}\) is a unit vector pointing from \(\mathrm{d}\vec{s}\) to \(P\).</li>
             <li>\(r\) is the distance from \(\mathrm{d}\vec{s}\) to \(P\).</li>
         </ul>

         The magnetic field due to a long straight wire. TODO 

         The magnetic field due to a circuilar arc. TODO 

         Right-hand rule 2. Grasp the wire with your thumb in the direction of \(i\). Your fingers will curl in the direction of \(\vec{B}\).
