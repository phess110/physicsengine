    <h2>Magnetic Flux &amp; Induced Current</h2>
    <p class="text" id="flux-text"> 
        Magnetic flux is defined as \(\Phi = \int \vec{B} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{A}\) and is measured in Webers. Faraday's law states that a changing magnetic flux through a conducting loop, induces an emf inside that loop,
        in particular, $$\mathcal{E} = - N\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi}{\mathrm{d}t}.$$Lenz's law states that the induced current in the loop has a direction so that the magnetic flux due to the induced current opposes the change in flux that induced the current.
        That is, a current will flow in a direction to prevent the current flux from changing.

        The induced current is caused by an induced electric field. $$\mathcal{E} q_0 = W = \oint \vec{F}\cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{s} = q_0\oint \vec{E}\cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{s}.$$
        Hence we obtain an equivalent form of Faraday's law: $$-\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi}{\mathrm{d}t} = \oint \vec{E}\cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{s}.$$
        Note: Electric potential only has meaning when \(E\) is produced from static charges (so the lines on \(E\) go from positive to negative); it has no meaning for \(E\) produced
         by induction (\(E\) lines form loops in this case, so \(\int E \cdot ds = 0\), which implies the emf is 0, yet work is being done to move charges).
    </p>

    <h2>Inductance</h2>
    <p class="text" id="inductance-text"> 
        Inductance is defined as \(L = \frac{N\Phi}{i}\) and is measured in Henrys. 

        <div class="example">For a solenoid, \(N\Phi = nl(BA)  = nl(\nu_0 i n) A\). Hence \(L = \mu_0 n^2 l A.\)</div>
    </p>

    <h2>Energy of a magnetic field</h2>
    <p class="text" id="mag-energy-text"> 
        We have \(L i = N \Phi\). Taking time derivatives, we have \(\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{induced}} = L \frac{\mathrm{d}i}{\mathrm{d}t}.\)

        If we attach an inductor to an emf source and a current \(i\) is flowing, then the rate at which the emf device delivers energy to the inductor 
        is the rate at which magnetic potential energy is stored in the magnetic field, i.e. \(\mathcal{E}i  = Li \frac{\mathrm{d}i}{\mathrm{d}t} =\frac{\mathrm{d}U_B}{\mathrm{d}t}.\)
        Hence $$U_B = \frac{1}{2}Li^2.$$
    </p>

    <h2>Energy Density of a magnetic field</h2>
    <p class="text" id="mag-energy-density-text"> 
        For a solenoid, \(\frac{U_B}{\mathrm{vol}} = \frac{Li^2}{2Al} = \frac{\mu_0 n^2 i^2}{2} = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\) since \(\frac{L}{l} = \mu_0n^2 A\)
        and \(B = \mu_0i n.\) In general, $$u_B =  \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}.$$
